- What is Computational Thinking
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
  - Algorithms
  - Abstraction
  - Decomposition
  - Patterns
  - Debugging 
- Computer Science vs Computational Thinking
- Computational Thinking vs Other Thinking
* Why
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- For our students
  - Expose them to the preliminaries of Computer Science
  - Give them additional problem solving tools
  - Relate different subject areas with a consistant language
- Also - CSforAll
* Challenges and solutions
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)_
** Challenges
- CT and CS are new to many teachers
- Teacher and student supports are limited
- The Digital Divide and equipment ralated challenges
** Soltutions
- Embed CT in core subjects to enhance instruction
- Use unplugged techniques that can lead to plugged activities
- Create a support network of educators
* Summer PD
- Introduction to CT (unplugged)
- Introduction to CT (plugged)
- Embedding CT into other subjects
- Lesson and unit development
* School Year implementation
- Deliver CT in core subject areas with support
- Work with a student teacher
