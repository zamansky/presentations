#+BEGIN_NOTES
- came in with minimal teacher prep
- wouldn't hire myself
- learned through apprenticeship
- learned to be skeptical of "research"
- go over how I was certified
#+END_NOTES

* NYC History
- Spring 1984 - First administration of APCS
- 1990s
  - Computer Math
  - Misc Programming classes
  - APCS A / AB
- Late 90s, early 2000s
  - Lobbying from individual teachers
#+REVEAL: split
- ~2009
  - NY Tech players become involved
  - NYC Mayor Bloomberg becomes involved
- 2012 - AFSE
- 2015 
  - Mayor di Blasio CS4All 
  - Programs like SEP, TEALS and others

- 2016 - Hunter starts talking to Albany
- 2017 - My first visit to Albany
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Opposition from NYSUT
- Interest across state
- Probably more industry push than academic
#+END_NOTES


* NY State Certification Requirements
- K12 Certification
- 12 CS Credits in program
- 50 fieldwork hours for certificate
- Five major "areas:"
  - Algorithms and Programming	
  - Computing Systems	
  - Data and Analysis	
  - Impacts of computing	
  - Networks and the Internet
- Will create a certification exam
- Will work on standards
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Why k12 is bad - too much for elementary teachers
- Standards are for tests when you have good teachers
#+END_NOTES

* Why Hunter?
- Long standing reputation for teacher prep
- Hidden strengths of the Hunter School of Education
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- cost/location/adjuncts
#+END_NOTES
* Hallmarks of Hunter's approach
- Designed from a practitioner perspective
- Active involvement from both CS and Ed sides
- Not tied to any particular course, framework or curriculum
- Combines content and pedagogy
- "Extras" woven throughout
  - Ethics
  - Tools
  - Full pipeline sensibilities
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- curricula and frameworks  - talk about all of them
- tools - must give teachers a practical set to start with
- will talk about pipeline more later
#+END_NOTES
* Content
- Depth
- Breadth
- Fulfilling state requirements
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- talk about each bullet in depth 
  - don't need algorithms but had to include it
- no math for math teacher courses
- talk about having to rename courses
- roughly a minor - most areas require too many credits
#+END_NOTES
* Pedagogy
- Methods 1 and 2
- Curriculum development
- Content in ed courses.
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- content heavy pedagogy courses
- choosing a language, other peoples code, code reading
- go over the tools/languages we teach and why
- Modeling good teaching 
- Why curriculum course
- On curriculum development why I don't believe in standards.
- curriculum course and field work
#+END_NOTES

* Fieldwork
- All grade bands
- Finding suitable placements
- Making it legal
- Making it good
* Extras
- Must be worked throughout the core
- Ethics
- Full pipeline sensibilities
   - designing full experiences for students
   - teachers who know full pipeline from previous grades to workforce

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Full pipeline - students from before to after they leave you
- Fill pipeline - teachers - all the way to continuing pd
- Modeling good teaching 
- Modeling good CS
- Daily digital / current events
 #+END_NOTES
* Extras 
- Tools
  - Using real tools throughout the program
  - Leave teachers with at least one practical set of tools-
    - GitHub in teacher program -> GitHub in classrooms
    - Slack / mail lists
    - transition - learning IDEs vs pro tools 
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- must be baked in 
  - talk about why ethics course "bad" even though I'm making ones
- tools lets you model 
  - maybe show GitHub or at least talk about it.
#+END_NOTES
* Ongoing support
- Ongoing PD at Hunter
- Ongoing PD with Tech Sector partners
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- CTLE hours
- Intern at tech companies
#+END_NOTES


* Differing opinions 
- Not enough jobs for full time teachers
- It's too hard
- We'll lose them all to industry

* Takeaways
- Content + Pedagogy
- Tools to support them from day 1
