My degree is in history. I didn’t use it professionally, but it has
enriched my life in numerous ways. I see today’s news in a larger
context of what has come before. The struggles of so many groups
throughout history just to be treated fairly—from Blacks, to Asians,
to Jews, to Muslims, to Catholics, to Irish, and so on—has made me
more empathetic to all people.
